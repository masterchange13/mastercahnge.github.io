    <p>the cold wind is blowing.<br>

        the snow falls where it did in those years, and i don't notice them anymore. things more important than falling snow are beginning to come to life. at the age of thirty, i seem indifferent to the coming of this winter, but it seems that i have been listening to the sound of snow, looking forward to another snow quietly covering the village and fields.<br>
<br>        
        i sat in the room, a few steamed buns on the stove, a small dish of pickles on a wooden bench beside the stove, the light in the room was dim. after a long time, i also remember that i was in such a snowy day, hugging the stove, eating pickles and eating momos thinking about some people and things, thinking deeply and deeply. the firewood fluttered in the stove, the fire was red, my hands and face were hot, but my back was still cold. the cold wind was blowing in through a crack in the door i could not see. winter once again came to the village, to my home. i carried everything i was afraid of freezing into the house, taped up the windows, and hung up the cotton curtains of last winter, but the cold wind still came in. he knows every little crack in the wall better than i do.<br>
        just the day before, it seemed to me that the snow was coming. i cut enough firewood to burn half a month, and neatly stacked it under the windowsill; by sweeping the yard clean, you unwittingly welcome a long-lost guest of honor -- brushing aside some of your life to make a clean space for the snow to fall. in the afternoon i went out of the village and took a walk in the fields. i will stand in the snow all winter without looking up a field of sunflower stalks that have been cut back. every year before the snow, there are one or two things that can not be done and put on hold for the winter. in winter, how many people put down a year of things, like me with their own ice hand, from beginning to end to touch their own life.<br>
<br>        
        the room was darker and i couldn't see the snow. but i know the snow is falling, falling all over the sky. on rooftops and woodpiles, on swept yards, on roads far and near. i'll wait until the snow settles before i go out. i would no longer stand under the eaves and watch for a long time with inexplicable excitement when the first snow fell, or dive into the snow with my bare head, as if i meant to let the snow know that there was such a person in the world, but did not know that the cold had already stared at my lively young life.<br>
<br>        
        after many winters, i gradually understand that i can no longer hide from the snow, whether i curled up in the house, or far away in another place in the winter, the snow will fall in a period of time that i am experiencing. when a man's years are open like a wilderness, he can no longer look after himself. like right now, i'm hanging around the fire, trying to warm myself up. one of my bones, but exposed outside in the cold wind, faint pain. it was a bone that i had frozen many years ago, and i could no longer pick it up by the fire like a cow bone. it froze forever on the snowy road before dawn. that winter i was fourteen years old, driving an oxcart to the desert to draw firewood. at that time, the people of the village depended on a bush called saxoul, which grew in the desert, to warm themselves through the winter. because of constant cutting and digging, the firewood is farther and farther away. it often takes half the night to haul back a load of firewood. every time i pulled firewood, it was my mother who got up in the middle of the night to cook the meal, fill the water and momos, and then wake me up. sometimes my father would get up and help me hitch the car. my understanding of cold began on those nights.<br>
<br>        
        as soon as the ox and cart came out of the village, the cold came from all sides, stripping away the warmth you had brought out of your home, leaving you with nothing but cold.<br>
<br>       
        it was no colder that night than any other.<br>
<br>        
        only this time, it was me alone driving an oxcart into the desert. in the past, as soon as the oxcarts left the village, the sound of other oxcarts moving on the snowy roads far and near would be heard, and the vague shouts of their drivers. just a short drive, you will catch up with one or more ox carts to pull wood, a long string, slowly through the leaden winter night. it was a cold night like that. because the cold wind is blowing several people, the same village, the neighboring village, know and do not know several ox carts in this night road against the cold.<br>
<br>       
        and this time, a wild wind blows me alone. the cold seems to have swept away everything else. now deal with me, all of it.<br>
        i tucked in my sheepskin coat and lay motionless in the cart, not daring to shout to the cow, lest more cold find me. from that night i learned how to hide warmth -- the warmth in my body that was retreating to a secret and deep place that sometimes i could not find -- and i used this deep warmth sparingly in my love life for many years to come. my relatives say that i am a very cold person, no, i gave you the only warmth.<br>
<br>        
        many years later, there was a cold wind, from the depths of my heart that i thought was hot and warm and had never been immersed in the cold, when i found that it was useless to wear thick cotton clothes. life itself has a winter, and it has come.<br>
<br>        
        at daybreak, the oxcart finally reached the place where there was firewood. one of my legs was frozen and i couldn't feel it. i tentatively jumped off with the other leg, leaned on a firewood stick for a while, and lit a fire for a while, barely able to walk. but a bone in my leg hurt like nothing i had ever known before, like needles driving through the bone and into the marrow -- a pain that lasted through all the winter and the cold summer days.<br>
<br>        
        when it was nearly dark, i returned home with half a car of firewood, and my father asked me: how did i pull this wood, not enough for two days to burn? i didn't say anything, and i didn't tell my family about my frozen leg.<br>
<br>        
        i think it'll warm up soon.<br>
<br>       
        if the winter had been a little shorter, if the fire at home had been a little hotter, if i had taken this leg a little more seriously, maybe i could have warmed up. but now i can't. how many seasons, tonight i, around the stove, no longer warm the distant winter of me; that on the way to school accidentally fell into the ice hole, covered with ice running back; the one stamping on my frozen feet and covering my ears waiting anxiously outside a door... i can't bring them back to this warm stove. i have prepared a lot of firewood for this winter. i'm only 30. i'll make it through the winter.<br>
<br>       
        but i'm sure there are some people around me who don't get through the winter like i do. they were kept. winter always cold a person year after year, first a leg, a bone, an expression, a mood... and then my whole life.<br>
<br>        
        i once let a man in on a cold morning, covered in frost, and poured him a cup of hot tea. it was an old man, with much of the cold of winter upon him, and as he sat by my fire the fire grew pale in a moment. i did not ask his name, but on the other side of the fire i felt the deep chill of an old man approaching me.<br>
<br>       
        he didn't say a word. i'm sure his words are all frozen hard and will take a while to melt.<br>
<br>        
        after sitting for about half an hour, he stood up, nodded at me, opened the door and left. i thought he was warming up.<br>
<br>        
        the next afternoon they heard that a man had frozen to death on the west side of the village. i ran over and saw this elderly man lying on the side of the road with half his face buried in the snow.<br>
        
        first time i've seen a man freeze to death.<br>
        i can't believe he's dead. there must be some warmth in his life that we can't see. a last faint struggle we can't see. the calls and moans were inaudible.<br>
<br>        
        we think he's dead. it was completely frozen.<br>
<br>        
        how could he keep any warmth in his body? by what to keep. his old padded jacket with holes in it and the cotton sticking out? those shoes with the bottom worn through and the side peeling off? and his mind colder than many winters put together? ...<br>
<br>        
        we can't see all the snow that falls in a person's life. everyone spends the winter alone in their own lives. we can't help anyone. my little fire was obviously nothing to this poor man all his life. his cold is too great.<br>
<br>        
        i had an aunt who lived in a village beyond the river, and many winters ago my brothers and i used to walk hand in hand across the frozen river to visit her. every time before parting, aunt always say: it's hot, let your mother come to make noise.<br>
<br>        
        my aunt was old and ill, and she was always afraid that she would not survive the winter. when it was cold, she would stay indoors and cuddle up to the fire in a low mud hut, waiting for spring to come.<br>
<br>        
        when a person is old, he is so eager for spring to come. though spring had come, she had not a leaf to bud, not a flower to open. spring just comes to the earth, to the lives of others. but she longed for spring, and she was afraid of the cold.<br>
<br>        
        i never forgot my aunt's words, and i told them to my mother more than once. mother just looked at me and went about her work. the mother was not alone in the winter, she had five or six children who had not grown up, and she had to pull them through the winter without letting any of them get cold. she looked forward to spring as much as her aunt.<br>
<br>        
        ... when it was hot, my mother would take us across the river to visit my aunt in the village on the other side. my aunt would also come out of the mud house where she lived for a winter and talk and laugh with us in the warm sun in the yard... how many years have passed and we have not waited for this spring. it seems that the "day" in aunt's sentence has not been hot.<br>
        my aunt died one winter a few years later. i went home for the new year, remember it is the fourth day of the new year, i accompanied my mother along a road about to thaw back. my mother told me about my aunt's death on that trip. she said, "your aunt is dead."<br>
<br>        
        my mother spoke so flatly as if she were talking about something that had nothing to do with death.<br>
<br>        
        "how did you die?" i seem to ask more prosaic.<br>
<br>        
        my mother didn't answer me directly. all she said was, "your brother and brother went over and helped take care of things."<br>
<br>        
        we didn't talk about it for a while, just walking quietly. near the door, the mother said: the day is hot.<br>
<br>        
        i looked up at my mother. she was steaming, perhaps from walking, but it was really getting hot. for my mother, the winter was over.<br>
<br>        
        "come and make noise when it's hot." i remembered my aunt's words again. this spring no longer belongs to my aunt. she survived many winters and was kept by this one. i remembered that my grandparents died a few winters ago. mother is alive. we'll have fewer and fewer relatives in the world. i told myself that we should always come and sit with my mother, whether it was hot or cold.<br>
<br>        
        the mother brought up her seven children. she's getting old. our seven children growing up may be able to block a bit of cold for our mother. whenever the children return home, the mother will be particularly happy, and the family will immediately add a lively atmosphere.<br>
<br>        
        but my mother's gray temples clearly let me feel that her winter has come, the snow began not to retreat, the frost began not to melt - whether the spring is coming, or the filial piety and warmth of the children.<br>
<br>        
        after 30 years of such a life distance, i feel the deep cold of my mother alone in winter. there's nothing i can do.<br>
<br>        
        the snow is falling harder and harder. it was completely dark.<br>
<br>        
        i held the fire around me, and warmed a moment of a long life. i know that beyond this moment, the rest of my years, the years of my loved ones, are far outside in the snow, blown through by the cold wind.<br>
